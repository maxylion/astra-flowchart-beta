Volesus: "Hey, Vitus. It's late, but do you want to read this together?"
(He hands Vitus a crudely-fashioned book. It's old, well-worn, and he's held it more times than he could count.)
(The tome of the Crown Mages.)
(It's a simple, earnest request. Vitus sits down, and opens the book once more.)
"Aeons ago, Mukaki came into this world, a devil who fought to twist the virtues of those around him."
"With the spread of his influence upon the land, those who fought in the ensuing Trials became known as Heroes."
"The divine god, Makari-Hari, along with these Heroes sealed away Mukaki in a great Trial, bringing peace to the land."
"In the aftermath, Makari-Hari left the seal in the hands of his followers, a gift of duty before returning to paradise."
"In the many, many years since, the role of sheltering this tale of a god, a devil, and the many braves heroes, has fallen to you..."
"...the future of the Crown Mages."
(Together, the two sit in the fading candlelight.)
(The stone below lingering with warmth from a sunny day, the sky above filled with endless stars. Their home, and everything beyond.)
(Vitus thinks to himself... "If I feel something, does that make it right?")
(The flames flicker out.)
